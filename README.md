RedPotion
===================

This is an example application that was used in my talk at the London RubyMotion
meet up. RedPotion aims to provide a clean and organised structure to iOS
application built with RubyMotion. To do this, it provides a set of clear
conventions and commonly used gems. It's also extremelly flexible, allowing the
developer to fallback to the Cocoa API when needed.

The slides are coming soon.

Some interesting things to note:

- The use of state in the user screen
- Ease of mapping table data from an API endpoint
- The "niceness" of a ProMotion AppDelegate class

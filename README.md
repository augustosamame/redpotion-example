RedPotion
===================

This is an example application that was used in my talk at the London RubyMotion
meet up.

The slides are coming soon.

Some interesting things to note:

- The use of state in the user screen
- Ease of mapping table data from an API endpoint
- The "niceness" of a ProMotion AppDelegate class
